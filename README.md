This project addresses the critical need for analyzing user activity data to uncover trends, make accurate predictions about future engagement, 
and provide actionable insights for stakeholders. By leveraging data driven strategies, this analysis aims to empower decision makers in 
improving player retention, optimizing server capacities, and tailoring marketing initiatives such as when to drop more content to keep players 
engaged. Without a clear understanding of player patterns, gaming companies risk inefficient resource allocation and missed opportunities to 
enhance user experiences. The focus is on identifying key trends, understanding the drivers of player activity, and building predictive models 
to forecast future player engagement.
